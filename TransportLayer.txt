Purpose is to provide Logical communication service to appliction running on hosts.

Transport layer tranforms the messages it recieves from the application layer into segments.

It breaks the message into chunks/segments and adds a transport layer header.

Transport Layer provides logical communication between application/processes
Network Layer provids logical communication between host/computers.

2 transport layer protocols: UDP AND TCP
UDP = Unreliable,connectionless,
TCP = Reliable,connection oriented

demultiplexing is the process of transport layer segments being delivered to a socket on the recieving host.
 The job of gathering data chunks at the source host from different sockets,encapsulating each data chunk with header information to
create segments, and passing the segments to the network layer is called multiplexing.
