The internet is a bunch of end systems connected to each other. 
They share and request services like email,http,file transfer.
The end systems communicate with each other using different protocols.
These protocols are known as TCP/IP
These protocols define the rules end systems/hosts will follow to share/recieve services/data

Application - http,dns,smtp (email)
transport - transports application layer data/messages betweek applications using UDP AND TCP - Segments data
Network - Transports datagrams to transport layer
Link - Routes datagram through routers
Physical - transports bits through physical medium like cables

OSI MODEL
application layer
presentation layer
session layer
transport layer
network layer
data link layer
physical layer

As data moves down the 5 layer TCP/IP stack it encapsulates.

At the application layer a message is passed down to the transport layer.
At the transport layer it adds header information to the message and passes the segment to the network layer.
Network layer adds info such as source and destination address. Passes datagram to link layer.
Link layer adds info and creates frame which gets passed down to physical layer.
